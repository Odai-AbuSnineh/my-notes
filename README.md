## What I’ve learned

One of the points that I learned from [good-developer-mindset](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-fundamentals-of-a-good-developer-mindset-in-15-minutes-81321ab8a682/) is the following :

+ Your first reaction to changing requests should be “NO’’.

+ You should add logging in a very early stage. This will help you to find the problem easily and save your time.

+ Don’t depend on external technologies. But when you must do so, try to reduce your dependency on them as much as you can. --
