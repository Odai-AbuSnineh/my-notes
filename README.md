## The things I learned :

One of the points that I learned from [good-developer-mindset](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-fundamentals-of-a-good-developer-mindset-in-15-minutes-81321ab8a682/) is the following :

+	Be independent of external technologies. But when you must do so, try to reduce your dependency on them as much as you can.

+	Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future.

+	The real purpose of comments is to explain “WHY” you did something, not “WHAT” the code is doing.

+	You should add logging in a very early stage. This will help you to find the problem easily and save your time.

+ Your initial reaction to the requested change must be ‘NO'.


+ Bad developers don’t understand what they are doing, and good developers do. It really is that simple.
